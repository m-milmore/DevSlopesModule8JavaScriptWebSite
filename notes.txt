In HTML
The attribute name begins with data-. It can contain only letters, numbers, dashes (-), periods (.), colons (:), and underscores (_). Any ASCII capital letters (A to Z) are converted to lowercase.
In JavaScript
The property name of a custom data attribute is the same as the HTML attribute without the data- prefix, and removes single dashes (-) for when to capitalize the property's "camelCased" name.
